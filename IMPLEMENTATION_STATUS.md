## Recent Major Updates

### October 8, 2025 - Control Plane Implementation ✅
- ✅ Created complete `internal/controlplane/` package
- ✅ Implemented all 6 control plane API methods
- ✅ Added comprehensive unit tests (77.5% coverage)
- ✅ Integrated with main agent
- ✅ Updated registration, heartbeat, and status reporting

## Conclusion

The PipeOps VM Agent is **~75% complete** and approaching production readiness. The most critical gap (control plane communication) has been successfully implemented and tested.

**Production Readiness Assessment:**
- ✅ Core functionality complete
- ✅ Critical control plane communication implemented
- ✅ Installation and deployment ready
- ⚠️ Testing needs significant expansion (highest priority)
- ⚠️ Command execution needs completion
- ❌ CI/CD pipeline needs implementation

**Estimated Time to Production-Ready:** 4-6 weeks with focused effort on testing, command execution, and CI/CD.

**Next Immediate Steps:**
1. Implement command execution loop (4 days)
2. Add Kubernetes client tests (3 days)
3. Add integration tests (3 days)
4. Setup CI/CD pipeline (2 days)
5. Load testing and performance validation (2 days)
