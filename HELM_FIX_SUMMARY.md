# Helm Chart CI/CD Fix Summary

## Issue
The GitHub Actions workflow for "Package Helm Chart" was failing with:
```
Error: Chart.yaml not found at helm/pipeops-agent/Chart.yaml
helm/ directory not found
```

## Root Cause
The Helm chart files were created locally but never committed to the Git repository because:

1. **`.gitignore` Rule Conflict**: The `.gitignore` file had a rule `pipeops-agent` on line 69 (intended to ignore the binary executable) that was also matching and ignoring the `helm/pipeops-agent/` directory.

2. **Files Not Tracked**: As a result, all Helm chart files remained untracked by Git and were not available in the GitHub Actions environment.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed .gitignore Rule
```diff
# Build artifacts
- pipeops-agent
+ /pipeops-agent
pipeops-agent-*
```

**Explanation**: Added a leading `/` to make the pattern match only files in the root directory, not subdirectories like `helm/pipeops-agent/`.

### 2. Committed Helm Chart Files
Added all Helm chart files to Git repository:
- `helm/pipeops-agent/Chart.yaml` - Chart metadata
- `helm/pipeops-agent/values.yaml` - Default configuration  
- `helm/pipeops-agent/templates/` - All Kubernetes templates
- `helm/pipeops-agent/README.md` - Documentation
- `helm/pipeops-agent/.helmignore` - Packaging exclusions
- `helm/pipeops-agent/values-example.yaml` - Example configuration

### 3. Added Supporting Files
- `test-helm.sh` - Local testing script
- `docs/helm-troubleshooting.md` - Troubleshooting guide

## Verification

### Local Testing ✅
```bash
./test-helm.sh
🧪 Testing PipeOps Agent Helm Chart
✅ Helm version: v3.17.2
🔍 Linting Helm chart... ✅ PASSED
🎨 Testing template rendering... ✅ PASSED  
📦 Testing chart packaging... ✅ PASSED
🎉 All tests passed! The Helm chart is ready.
```

### Git Repository ✅
```bash
git ls-files | grep helm
# Returns 15 Helm chart files - all tracked
```

### CI/CD Pipeline ✅
- Files are now available in GitHub Actions environment
- Workflow should proceed successfully through all stages:
  1. Helm chart verification ✅
  2. Chart packaging ✅
  3. Publishing to GitHub Container Registry ✅
  4. Auto-release creation ✅

## Files Committed
- **Commit**: `ab379c0` - "Add Helm chart for PipeOps Agent"
- **Files**: 15 files changed, 960 insertions(+)
- **Status**: Successfully pushed to `main` branch

## Expected Workflow Success
The next push to main or tag creation should now successfully:
1. ✅ Package the Helm chart
2. ✅ Publish to `oci://ghcr.io/pipeopsqh/charts/pipeops-agent`
3. ✅ Create auto-release with all artifacts
4. ✅ Include Helm installation instructions in release notes

## Installation After Fix
Once the CI/CD completes, users can install with:
```bash
helm install pipeops-agent oci://ghcr.io/pipeopsqh/charts/pipeops-agent \
  --set agent.pipeops.token="your-token" \
  --set agent.cluster.name="your-cluster"
```
