## Test Patterns and Best Practices

### Consistent Testing Approach
All tests follow these patterns:
1. **Setup**: Create test configuration/data
2. **Execute**: Run the function under test
3. **Verify**: Assert expected behavior using testify assertions
4. **Cleanup**: Use `defer` for resource cleanup

### Mocking Strategy
- HTTP servers: `httptest.NewServer`
- Loggers: `logrus.New()` with error level for quiet tests
- Contexts: `context.Background()` for testing
- Time-based tests: Use actual `time` package with short durations

### Error Handling Tests
- Test both success and failure paths
- Verify error messages contain expected information
- Test edge cases (empty strings, nil values, invalid formats)

### Integration Tests
- Test component initialization
- Test lifecycle operations (Start/Stop)
- Test interactions between components
- Use short timeouts for non-blocking tests

## Running Tests

### Run all tests
```bash
make test
```

### Run tests with coverage
```bash
make test-coverage
# Opens coverage.html in browser
```

### Run tests for specific module
```bash
go test -v ./internal/server/...
go test -v ./pkg/state/...
```

### Run tests with race detection
```bash
go test -v -race ./...
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Fixed Critical Bug
- **Issue**: Registration test was expecting wrong API endpoint
- **Fix**: Updated to use `/api/v1/clusters/agent/register`
- **Impact**: All controlplane tests now pass

### 2. Comprehensive HTTP Endpoint Testing
- All server endpoints now have dedicated tests
- Health checks, metrics, and version endpoints covered
- WebSocket and SSE functionality tested
- 77.6% coverage for server module

### 3. State Management Testing
- ConfigMap-based persistence tested
- In-memory fallback behavior verified
- Error handling for missing data tested
- 47.6% coverage for state module

### 4. Version Module - 100% Coverage
- All version functions tested
- Build info structure validated
- Version string formatting verified
- Complete coverage achieved

### 5. Tunnel Management Tests
- Lifecycle management tested
- Configuration validation covered
- Duration parsing with defaults
- 32.1% coverage for tunnel module

## Future Testing Opportunities

While coverage has significantly improved, there are still areas for expansion:

1. **Agent Module** (currently 0%)
   - Main agent orchestration logic
   - Integration with other components
   - Full lifecycle testing

2. **Monitoring Module** (currently 0%)
   - Helm chart management
   - Monitoring stack integration
   - Port forwarding logic

3. **Tunnel Client** (partially covered)
   - Chisel client operations
   - Connection management
   - Reconnection logic

4. **Integration Tests**
   - End-to-end workflow tests
   - Multi-component interaction tests
   - Real Kubernetes cluster tests

## Continuous Integration

Tests are designed to:
- ✅ Run quickly (< 1 second for most modules)
- ✅ Work without external dependencies
- ✅ Be deterministic and reliable
- ✅ Provide clear failure messages
- ✅ Use minimal resources

## Conclusion

The test coverage has been significantly improved from minimal coverage to comprehensive testing across key modules. All 77 tests pass successfully, providing confidence in the codebase's reliability and maintainability.
